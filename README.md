# Realtime Pizza Order Tracking Application


It is a Realtime Pizza Order Tracking Application in which user can order pizza with Card Payment/Cash On Delivery Payment after logging into the app. Admin(employee of pizza outlet) can track the statuses of all the current pizza orders with their payment status. User can also track the status of their pizza order which gets updated in realtime at the both ends(user & admin). User can see all their past orders as well. 


Frontend part of this app is built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, backend part using nodejs & express. Realtime communication between both ends is implemented using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and Card Payment is integrated using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in)
